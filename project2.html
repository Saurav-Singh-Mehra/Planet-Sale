                he smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than
                Earth's Moon. From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as
                it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter.
                Mercury's surface temperatures are both extremely hot and cold. Because the planet is so close to the
                Sun, day temperatures can reach highs of 800°F (430°C). Without an atmosphere to retain that heat at night,
                thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.

                Venus is the the second planet of the Solar System in order of distance from the Sun, being located 0.72
                astronomical units from it in the inner solar system. It has a similar size and composition to Earth, 
                with a diameter of 12,104 kilometers and a mass of 4.87 x 10^24 kilograms. The planet has a slow retrograde
                rotation, meaning it rotates on its axis in the opposite direction to its orbit around the sun, taking 243
                Earth days to complete one rotation. Venus has a thick atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide with
                trace amounts of nitrogen and other gases, as well as sulfuric acid clouds that obscure the surface from visible
                light. Due to its thick atmosphere and runaway greenhouse effect it experiences extreme surface temperatures, with
                a maximum temperature of 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius). Venus has been observed and studied
                 since ancient times, with the earliest recorded observations dating back to Babylonian astronomers in the 17th
                century BCE.

                Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit 
                of Neptune. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun. It is the largest known 
                trans-Neptunian object by volume, by a small margin, but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto 
                is made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets. Pluto has roughly one-sixth the mass of the Moon, 
                and one-third its volume.

                Pluto has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit, ranging from 30 to 49 astronomical units (4.5 to 7.3 billion kilometres; 2.8
                 to 4.6 billion miles) from the Sun. Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its orbital distance of 39.5 AU (5.91 
                 billion km; 3.67 billion mi). Pluto's eccentric orbit periodically brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital 
                 resonance prevents them from colliding.

                upiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than 2.5 times that 
                of all the other planets in the Solar System combined and slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Its diameter is eleven 
                times that of Earth, and a tenth that of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm), with an orbital period of 
                11.86 years. It is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky, after the Moon and Venus, and has been observed since 
                prehistoric times. Its name derives from that of Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.
                Jupiter was the first of the Sun's planets to form, and its inward migration during the primordial phase of the Solar System affected 
                much of the formation history of the other planets. Jupiter's atmosphere consists of 76% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass, with a denser interior
